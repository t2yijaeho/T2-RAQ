* Necessary to consider the backend state file lock and multi-user environment.
* The direct use of file locking is to limit access to state files

  [Protecting Access to Workspace State](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3#protecting-access-to-workspace-state)

## Q08. AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) Logging

* To check the detailed error history, you can enable cloud watch logging and check the detailed log history

  [AWS DMS task in an error status](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/dms-task-error-status/)

## Q09. Linux single dot directory

[Dot Definition](http://www.linfo.org/dot.html)

>This is a short string (i.e., sequence of characters) that is added to the end of the base name (i.e., the main part of the name) of a file or directory in order to indicate the type of file or directory.

>On Unix-like operating systems every directory contains, as a minimum, an object represented by a single dot and another represented by two successive dots. The former refers to the directory itself and the latter refers to its parent directory (i.e., the directory that contains it). These items are automatically created in every directory, as can be seen by using the ls command with its -a option (which instructs it to show all of its contents, including hidden items).

* Single Dot: Directory itself
* Double Dots: Parent directory

```Shell
git add .
git add -A
```

## Q10. AWS DMS Task Expressions

## Q14. MariaDB Backtick

* MariaDB uses a phonetic code (Backtick, located on the left side of keyboard number 1) to distinguish between general object identifiers and reserved words

>Identifiers may be quoted using the backtick character - `. Quoting is optional for identifiers that don't contain special characters, or for identifiers that are not reserved words

[Identifier Names](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/identifier-names/)

## Q15. utf8 vs. utf-8

* What is the diffrence between UTF-8, UTF8 and AL32UTF8?

>UTF-8 is a variable-width Unicode encoding and also a strict superset of 7-bit ASCII. One Unicode character can be 1 byte, 2 bytes, 3 bytes or 4 bytes in UTF-8.

>UTF8(without the dash) is the name of the Oracle character set introduced in Oracle 8.0 that follows the UTF-8 encoding. UTF8 supports UTF-8 encoding up to Unicode standard 3.0 only. 

>AL32UTF8 is the Oracle Unicode character set that supports the supplementary characters defined in the latest Unicode standard

>00933. 00000 -  "SQL command not properly ended"

>*Cause:    
*Action:

The error is caused by missing semicolons in the three SQL statements below.
Even if the comment content is not added, the lab is not affected

```
COMMENT ON TABLE regions 
IS 'Regions table that contains region numbers and names. Contains 4 rows; references with the Countries table.'

COMMENT ON COLUMN regions.region_id
IS 'Primary key of regions table.'

COMMENT ON COLUMN regions.region_name
IS 'Names of regions. Locations are in the countries of these regions.'
```

Cause
The message ORA-00933: sql command not properly ended. This error is usually caused by an SQL statement with a clause that is not allowed for that statement. Some examples that might cause this error are:

An INSERT statement with an ORDER BY clause or an INNER JOIN
A DELETE statement with an INNER JOIN or ORDER BY clause
An UPDATE statement with an INNER JOIN
If the SQL syntax is incorrect.
The error also might occur because of using a semicolon ";" at the end or incorrect syntax since the other causes involve joins.

## Q69. Amazon EC2 Instance Connect

As with Cloud Shell or Cloud IDE, Amazon EC2 Instance Connect is not accessed directly by the user's local client, but through the endpoint of the service, so the CIDR of the service to be accessed must be registered in the security group of the service.

## Q94. Jump Host

To connect to the admin server

1. Connect to the public IP of the bastion server in the local environment
2. Connect to the admin server private IP from the bastion server

## Q97. Amazon RDS Endpoint naming format

>1.Is there some way to "predict" or otherwise determine what the hexchars will be?
>
>You can't predict it, but once you create at least one instance in a region you will know what it is for your account in that region (and it will be the same for all RDS instances belonging to the same account in that region).

>2.Is there a way to set this?
>
>No. The "hexchars" component is generated internally and is unique to your AWS account in each region (cannot be changed). The "hexchars" will be different for the same account in a different region.

>3.Is the hexchars consistent if the instance ID is consistent?
>
>Yes. You can delete an instance and if you create another with the same name, it will have the same endpoint address as the original instance (for the same AWS account in the same region). Also, if you rename an instance from "myinst1" to "myinst2", the first component is the only that changes and the "hexchars.region.rds.amazonaws.com" remains the same.

## Q98. Amazon EBS CSI driver

>CSI drivers
>* replace the Kubernetes "in-tree" storage drivers that exist in the Kubernetes project source code.
>* work with storage providers, such as Amazon EBS.
>* provide a simplified plugin model that make it easier for storage providers like AWS to release features and maintain support without depending on the Kubernetes release cycle.
